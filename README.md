# top-down-weapons-and-magic
Code Demo for top down weapons and spells as resources featuring animations

# Code

Check `res://weapon` for the Weapons. They are Resources, that include the Scene that is to be instantiated in the Players hand among other things.

# Notes

Made a stupid initial design choice to orient objects facing up instead of facing right ( how godot likes it ). Don't do this in your project..
